# Final Project

For the final project in the class, you are required to build a plugin of your choosing. The plugin should focus on using WordPress core APIs in order to improve your ability to work with WordPress.

The project will consist of three parts: the proposal, the plugin, and the presentation.

## The Proposal/Readme.txt (5 points)

Like a plugin in the [WordPress.org plugin repository](http://wordpress.org/plugins/), your project will need a **readme.txt** file that states the purpose of the plugin. A plugin's [readme file](http://wordpress.org/plugins/about/readme.txt) describes what a plugin does, how to install it, documents changes to the plugin and shows screenshots of the plugin. This information is used to display the different sections found in the plugin page for a plugin on the WordPress.org plugin repository.

For the final plugin, your first step is to write the **readme.txt** file. The purpose of this assignment is to *clearly articulate* the functionality for the plugin. Your final grade will depend upon your ability to meet the functionality detailed in the **readme.txt** file. If your plugin does not do what it says it should do, you will receive fewer points for the project.

To write your **readme.txt** file, please copy and modify the sample [readme.txt file](http://wordpress.org/plugins/about/readme.txt) provided by WordPress.org. The **readme.txt** file uses [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) for styling. 

Specifically, for this assignment, I expect you to:

1. Complete the **Description** section with excessive detail. You should explain *everything* about what your plugin *should do*. Feel free to write step by step instructions for how the plugin should function. This is your chance to really think about and articulate how the plugin should function.
1. You can copy the **Instructions** section verbatim from the sample **readme.txt** file *unless* you anticipate that you will need to add additional steps to the process.
1. The **Frequently Asked Questions** section is optional; however, it may be a good place to articulate specific features of the plugin. Sometimes, a question and answer format can lead to additional clarity when describing your plugin.
1. As your plugin does not yet exist, it is obviously difficult to complete the **Screenshots** section. If you believe that it will be helpful to explain your plugin's functionality using some mockup screenshots, please feel free to use the screenshots section for this purpose. Please note that this section should compliment your description, not replace it.
1. The **Changlelog** and **Upgrade Notice** sections should both hold the following text only:

> = 1.0 =

> Initial release

Please run your **readme.txt** file through the [readme.txt](http://wordpress.org/plugins/about/validator/) validator. This will help remind you if you have missed a section or done anything incorrectly.

This part of the assignment is due on August 5, 2013 at 6 PM PST. You should email me a copy of the **readme.txt** file, as well as any images needed for the Screenshots section.

After submitting the initial **readme.txt** file, you will receive feedback from the instructor. At this point, feedback is primarily aimed at ensuring that you are proposing an appropriate plugin project for this class.

## The Plugin (40 points)

The final plugin is due as a zip file on September 9th at 6 PM PST. It is important that you submit a polished final product. The plugin should be ready to distribute publicly, including a final readme.txt file and any necessary screenshots. The final plugin will be graded according to the following rubric:

| Area                           | Points |
| :----------------------------: | :----: |
| Plugin installs without errors | 5      |
| Plugin functions as described  | 20     |
| Code follows best practices    | 15     |

## The Presentation (5 points)

All presentations will take place on the final day of class. The presentations will be up to 5 minutes long, with an additional 2 minutes for questions. Successful presentations should include the following information:

* Explains the problem that the plugin solves
* Demonstrates how the plugin works
* Explains how the plugin solves the problem

The manner in which the plugin is presented is up to the presenter; however, you will likely need to show screenshots, live demonstrations, and/or code to successfully demonstrate your plugin.
